\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider lists made from the letters T, H, E, O, R, Y, with repetition allowed.
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Length 4 lists: \textbf{6x6x6x6}
	    \item Length 4 lists that begin with T: \textbf{1x6x6x6}
	    \item Length 4 lists that do not begin with T: \textbf{5x6x6x6}
	\end{itemize}
    \item [3] How many lists of length 3 can be made from the symbols A, B, C, D, E, F if...
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item repetition is allowed: \textbf{6x6x6}
	    \item repetition is not allowed: \textbf{6x5x4}
	    \item repetition is not allowed and the list must contain the letter A:\\
		(A,\_,\_) = 1x5x4\\
		(\_,A,\_) = 5x1x4\\
		(\_,\_,A) = 5x4x1\\
		\textbf{= 3(5x4)}
	    \item repetition is allowed and the list must contain the letter A:\\
		$|U| = 6x6x6, |X^c| = 5x5x5, |X| = (6x6x6)-(5x5x5)$
	\end{itemize}
    \item [5] This problem involves 8-digit binary strings such as 10011011 or 00001010 (i.e.,
8-digit numbers composed of 0’s and 1’s).
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item How many such string are there? \textbf{2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2}
	    \item How many such string end in 0? \textbf{2x2x2x2x2x2x2x1}

	    \item How many such string have 1's for their second or fourth digits?\\
		$|A\cup B| = 2x1x2x1x2x2x2x2$\\
		$|A| = 2x1x2x2x2x2x2x2$\\
		$|B| = 2x2x2x1x2x2x2x2$\\
		$= 2^7 + 2^7 - 2^6 = 192$
	\end{itemize}
    \item [7] This problem concerns 4-letter codes made from the letters A, B, C, D, ... , Z.
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item How many such codes can be made? \textbf{26x26x26x26}
	    \item How many such codes have no two consecutive letters the same?\\
		letter 1: any of all 26\\
		letter 2: 26 - the first = 25\\

\section*{Exercises for Section 4.3}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Five cards are dealt off of a standard 52-card deck and lined up in a row.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How many such lineups are there that have at least one red card?\\
		    $|U| = $52x51x50x49x48, $|X^c|$ = 26x25x24x23x22\\
		    \textbf{(52x51x50x49x48) - (26x25x24x23x22)}
		\item How many such lineups are there in which the cards are either all black or all hearts?\\
		    They are not black cards that are hearts, so we use the addition principle:\\
		    All black cards: 26x25x24x23x22\\
		    All hearts: 13x12x11x10x9\\
		    \textbf{(26x25x24x23x22) + (13x12x11x10x9)}
	\end{itemize}
    \item [3] Five cards are dealt off of a standard 52-card deck and lined up in a row.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How many such lineups are there in which all 5 cards are of the same color (i.e., all black or all red)?\\
		    There can't be black cards that are red, so we use addition principle:\\
		    All black cards: 26x25x24x23x22\\
		    All red cards: 26x25x24x23x22\\
		    \textbf{(26x25x24x23x22) + (26x25x24x23x22)}
	\end{itemize}
    \item [5] How many integers between 1 and 9999 have no repeated digits?\\
	1-digit: 9, 2-digit: 9x9, 3-digit: 9x9x8, 4-digit: 9x9x8x7\\
	\textbf{9+(9x9)+(9x9x8)+(9x9x8x7)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How many have at least one repeated digit?\\
		    Using the substraction principle:\\
		    $|U| = 9999, |x^c| =$ 9+(9x9)+(9x9x8)+(9x9x8x7)\\
		    $|X|$ = \textbf{9999 -(9+(9x9)+(9x9x8)+(9x9x8x7))}
	\end{itemize}
    \item [7] A password on a certain site must be five characters long, made from letters of the alphabet, and have at least one upper case letter.
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item How many different passwords are there?\\
		$|U| = 52^5, |X^c= 26^5|$\\
		$|X| = $\textbf{$52^5 - 26^5$}
	    \item What if there must be a mix of upper and lower case?\\
		$|U| = 52^5, |X^c= 26^5 \cdot 2|$\\
		$|X| = $\textbf{$52^5 - (26^5 + 26^5)$}
	\end{itemize}

digits and all digits are odd?\\
	Odds: 1,3,5,7,9, total 5 numbers. \textbf{=5!}
    \item [5] Using only pencil and paper, find the value of $\frac{120!}{118!}$\\
	$\frac{120\cdot 119 \cdot \cancel{118!}}{\cancel{118!}} = 120\cdot 119$
    \item [9] How many permutations of the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G are there in which the
three letters ABC appear consecutively, in alphabetical order?\\
	n = 7 - ABC = 5, \textbf{5!}

\end{enumerate}
\section*{Exercises for Section 4.5}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [5] How many 16-digit binary strings contain exactly seven 1’s? (Examples of such
strings include 0111000011110000 and 0011001100110010, etc.)\\
	$C_{16}^7 = \frac{16!}{7!9!}$
    \item [6] $|{X \in P({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}): |X| = 4}|$\\
	$= C_{10}^4 = \frac{10!}{4!6!}$
    \item [7] $|{X \in P({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}): |X| < 4}|$\\
	We can have a $\phi$ subset. Therefore $= C_{10}^0 + C_{10}^1 + C_{10}^2 + C_{10}^3$
    \item [17] How many 10-digit binary strings are there that have exactly four 1’s or exactly
five 1’s?\\
	$C_{10}^4 + C_{10}^5$
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item How many do not have exactly four 1’s or exactly five 1’s?\\
		$|U| = 2^{10}$\\
		$2^{10} - C_{10}^4 - C_{10}^5$
	\end{itemize}
    \item [19] A 5-card poker hand is called a flush if all cards are the same suit. How many
different flushes are there?\\
	There are 13 cards in each suit and there are 4 suits. There are $C_{13}^5 \cdot 4$ different flushes.
