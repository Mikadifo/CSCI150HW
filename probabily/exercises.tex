\begin{enumerate}
    \item A card is randomly selected from a deck of 52 cards. What is the chance that the card is red or a king?\\
	$|S| = 52$ , red = 26, kings = 4, $|E| = 28$\\
	$P(E) = \dfrac{28}{52}$
    \item[5] Toss a dice 5 times in a row. What is the probability that you will get the same number on each roll?\\
	$|S| = 6x6x6x6x6 = 6^5$, $|E| = \{all1, all2, all3, all4, all5, all6\} = 6$
	$p(E) = \dfrac{6}{6^5}$
    \item[7] You have a pair of dice, a white one and a black one. Toss them both. What is the probability that they show the same number?\\
	$|S| = 6x6, |E| = \{11,22,33,44,55,66\} = 6$\\
	$p(E) = \dfrac{6}{6x6}$
    \item[11] Toss a coin 8 times. Find the probability that the first and last tosses are heads.\\
	$|S| = 2^8, |E| = 1x2x2x2x2x2x2x1 = 1^2x2^6$\\
	$P(E) = \dfrac{2^6}{2^8}$
    \item[13] Five cards are dealt from a shuffled 52-card deck. What is the probability of getting three red cards and two clubs?\\
	$|S| = C_{52}^5, |E| = C_{26}^3 x C_{13}^2$\\
	$P(E) = \dfrac{C_{26}^3 x C_{13}^2}{C_{52}^5}$
    \item[15] Alice and Bob each randomly pick an integer from 0 to 9.
	$|S| = 10x10$
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item What is the probability that they pick the same number?\\
		$|E| = 10, P(E) = \dfrac{10}{10x10}$
	    \item What is the probability that they pick different numbers?\\
		$|E^c| = 100-10=90, P(E^c) = \dfrac{90}{10x10}$
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Exercises for Section 5.2}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A card is taken off the top of a shuffled 52-card deck. What is the probability that it is black or an ace?\\
	$|S| = 52, p(black) = \dfrac{26}{52}, p(ace)=\dfrac{4}{52}, p(A\cap B) = \dfrac{2}{52}$\\
	$p(A\cup B) =  4/52 + 26/52 - 2/52 = \dfrac{28}{52}$
    \item [3] What is the probability that a 5-card hand dealt off a shuffled 52-card deck contains at least one red card?\\
	$|S| = C_{52}^5, |E| = C_{26}^{5}, p(E^c) = 1 - \dfrac{C_{26}^5}{C_{52}^5}$
    \item [7] Two cards are dealt off a shuffled 52-card deck.What is the probability that the cards are both red or both aces?\\
	$|S| = C_{52}^2, |A|=C_{26}^2, |B|=C_{4}^2, |A\cap B| = 1$\\
	$p(A\cup B) = \dfrac{C_4^2}{C_{52}^2} + \dfrac{C_{26}^2}{C_{52}^2} - \dfrac{1}{C_{52}^2}$
    \item [11] A dice is rolled 5 times. Find the probability that not all of the tosses are even.\\
	$|S| = 5^5, |E| = 3^5, |E^c| = 5^5 - 3^5$\\
	$p(E^c) = \dfrac{5^5-3^5}{5^5}$
    \item [17] In a shuffled 52-card deck, what is the probability that neither the top nor bottom card is a heart?\\
	$|S| = 52x51, |E| = 39x38$\\
	$p(E)= \dfrac{39x38}{52x51}$
